## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the study titled **"Adaptive A-Star Path Planning with YOLOv11 Segmentation for Dynamic Autonomous Navigation"** This project focuses on enhancing autonomous navigation by combining advanced object detection with adaptive path planning to ensure safe and efficient movement in dynamic settings.

## Features

- **YOLOv11 Segmentation:** Utilizes the latest YOLOv11 model for high-accuracy object detection and segmentation.
- **Adaptive A-Star Path Planning:** Implements an enhanced A* algorithm that recalculates optimal paths in real-time in response to environmental changes.
- **Size-Aware Inflation Mechanism:** Dynamically adjusts obstacle boundaries based on the agent's dimensions to prevent collisions.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Ensures that all components operate responsively in dynamic environments.
- **Simulation Demonstrations:** Includes videos showcasing the integration and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

## Architecture

The system architecture comprises the following components:

1. **Object Detection:** YOLOv11 model for real-time segmentation and identification of obstacles.
2. **Path Planning:** Adaptive A* algorithm that responds to frame-by-frame environmental changes.
